# May-June 2020 Challenge

For this challenge, your task is to create a Python script or a Flask website that implements the Caesar's cipher.

### Caesar's cipher

Caesar's cipher is one of the most **basic encryption techniques** and you have very likely already used it before (usually kids in elementary school use it to share secret messages).

**How does it work?**

The technique is very simple: write the word that you want to encrypt and shift its letters by some number (according to the alphabet order). 

If you shift positions by 3, A becomes D, B becomes E and so on.

### Example

Let's encrypt the word **NINJA** using the Caesar's cipher by 3 letters (we'll use the English alphabet):

	English alphabet characters: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
	
	Plain text: NINJA
	
	Encrypted text: QLQMD

If the text receiver knows what encryption technique was used (Caesar's cipher) and by how many letters the alphabet was shifted (by 3) s/he can easily decrypt the message.

### Your task

Your task is to create a **Python program** (with GUI) **or** a **Flask website** that does the Caesar's cipher encryption.

**Important:**

- The program must have a **graphical user interface** (GUI). For a Python script you can use Tkinter. For a Flask web app you'll use HTML&CSS.
- You **must not use any external Python library** to do encryption for you. You can only use the Flask library if you're doing a Flask web app.
- In case you'll build a Flask web app, you **cannot do the encryption in JavaScript**. The encryption process must be done with Python.
- You can use **any alphabet** that you want, but let users know which alphabet you've used.

**Reference**

For reference, you can take a look at this website: [https://rot13.com/](https://rot13.com/) (ROT13 is another name for Caesar's cipher. ROT is short for rotating the alphabet characters).

### Where to submit the challenge

Push the code for the challenge on GitHub - either to ["normal" GitHub](https://github.com/), or to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) (but normal GitHub is preferred). Then send the link to Matej Ramuta on Slack (private message).

### Is design important?

For this challenge, the design does not matter that much, but in case there are multiple great solutions, the design might be the deciding factor in picking a winner.

### Due date

Please complete the challenge **until 30 June 2020** (the earlier, the better).

The winner will be declared by **7 July 2020**.

### What is the award for the winner?

Since this is a cryptography-related challenge, the award should be in line with that. 

That's why the award for the winner is a pack of [Crypto Cards](https://playcryptocards.com/). üÉè
